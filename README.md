Password Generator
This is a simple, responsive, and secure password generator built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to create strong, customizable passwords by selecting desired length and character types.

Features
Customizable Length: Generate passwords from 4 to 32 characters long.

Character Type Selection: Include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

Strong Randomness: Utilizes window.crypto.getRandomValues() for cryptographically secure random number generation.

Copy to Clipboard: Easily copy the generated password with a single click.

Responsive UI: Designed to work seamlessly across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Tailwind CSS.

Intuitive Interface: Clean and user-friendly design for a smooth experience.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure of the web page.

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For styling and responsiveness, leveraging utility-first classes via CDN.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For all the interactive logic and password generation.

├── style.css         // Contains custom CSS styles, linked from index.html
└── script.js         // Contains all the JavaScript logic for the generator, linked from index.html
